# Overview
This project started over 3 years ago, where I wanted to make something that would draw out football plays automatically. Last year I hit a break through in my python development where I could track players individually. Roboflow has allowed me to track players by position groups.

# Classes
Some of them are straight forward like Center, QB (quarterback), db (defensive back), lb (linebacker), but the rest are identified as skill. That means an offensive player like Runningback, Fullback, Tightend, H-back, Wide Reciever.

# The project in action
I haven't made a video with myself using roboflow but I will shortly. You can see the project on my linkedin and how it's grown and will continue to grow.
